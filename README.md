This repository contains scripts to automatically connect a Bluetooth headset to a device. The scripts are available in Fish shell, Bash, C, and Go languages.

To use the scripts, make sure that the Bluetooth headset is paired with your device and that Bluetooth is enabled on your device. Then, follow the instructions for the specific script you want to use:

- Fish shell: Save the script to a file (e.g. `connect_bluetooth_headset.fish`), make it executable using the `chmod +x` command, and run it by typing `./connect_bluetooth_headset.fish` in a terminal.

- Bash: Save the script to a file (e.g. `connect_bluetooth_headset.bash`), make it executable using the `chmod +x` command, and run it by typing `./connect_bluetooth_headset.bash` in a terminal.

- C: Save the script to a file (e.g. `connect_bluetooth_headset.c`), compile it using a C compiler (e.g. GCC) using the command `gcc -o connect_bluetooth_headset connect_bluetooth_headset.c`, and run the resulting executable file by typing `./connect_bluetooth_headset` in a terminal.

- Go: Save the script to a file (e.g. `connect_bluetooth_headset.go`), compile it using the Go compiler using the command `go build connect_bluetooth_headset.go`, and run the resulting executable file by typing `./connect_bluetooth_headset` in a terminal.

Note: These scripts assume that you have only one Bluetooth headset paired with your device. If you have multiple headsets paired, you may need to modify the scripts to specify which headset you want to connect to.
